# InstaLife: Analyzing 1 Million Synthetic Instagram User Profiles
### Business Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Digital Wellbeing Strategy

---

## Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of a synthetic dataset containing 1,000,000 Instagram user profiles from the 2025–2026 period. The objective is to evaluate the intersection of social media engagement, demographic factors, and self-reported health metrics.

As a Project Manager and Data Analyst, I have structured this repository to solve 10 specific business challenges. The analysis demonstrates how high-volume data can be leveraged to drive corporate growth while maintaining a focus on user health and ethical product design.

## Strategic Business Problems Addressed

### Pillar 1: Revenue and Growth
1. **Premium Subscription Propensity Model:** Utilized classification algorithms to identify the key drivers behind premium feature adoption, specifically correlating income levels and account integration with subscription likelihood.
2. **Ad-Targeting Optimization:** Segmented users based on lifestyle behaviors (exercise and diet) to increase ad relevance and improve predicted click-through rates.

### Pillar 2: Product Strategy and User Experience
3. **Feature Cannibalization Analysis:** Quantified the relationship between Reels consumption and traditional Feed engagement to inform resource allocation for future product development.
4. **User Persona Archetyping:** Implemented K-Means Clustering to categorize the user base into five distinct behavioral segments, enabling hyper-personalized marketing and product experiences.

### Pillar 3: User Health and Retention
5. **Burnout Early Warning System:** Identified the specific usage threshold (minutes per day) at which perceived stress scores increase and sleep quality begins to decline.
6. **Sleep-Engagement Equilibrium:** Determined the optimal daily usage window that maximizes platform engagement without negatively impacting user health metrics.
10. **Happiness-Driven Growth:** Modeled the impact of non-digital habits (reading and social events) on user happiness to support data-driven corporate social responsibility initiatives.

### Pillar 4: Operations and Security
7. **Security Friction Analysis:** Analyzed the impact of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on long-term user engagement, testing the hypothesis that increased security correlates with higher user trust.
8. **Notification Sensitivity:** Evaluated how notification response rates influence average session lengths to optimize push notification frequency.
9. **Regional Behavioral Divergence:** Compared content preferences between urban and rural demographics to assist in localized content curation and marketing.

## Technical Stack
* **Data Processing:** Polars (Optimized for 1,000,000+ rows).
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest, K-Means Clustering, Linear Regression).
* **Visualization:** Plotly Express (Interactive statistical charting).
* **Environment:** Google Colab / Python 3.11+.

## Key Strategic Findings
* **The 120-Minute Threshold:** Data indicates a significant spike in perceived stress scores once daily usage exceeds 120 minutes.
* **Security as a Trust Driver:** Users with biometric or 2FA security enabled demonstrate 15% higher platform loyalty scores compared to non-secured users.
* **Lifestyle Correlation:** Reading habits and physical exercise were found to be stronger predictors of self-reported happiness than absolute income level.
